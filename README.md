# PBL1_Computational_Programming_Project
This is a Computational Programming Project carried out by myself in the second term of First year studying in Danang University of Science an Technology.

The program utilizes the residual reduction method in computational methods to solve systems of linear algebraic equations using the C programming language for completion. It's a console application with a simple, easy-to-use interface.

Input: A file with the first line containing the number of rows of the matrix, followed by subsequent lines containing the coefficients of the matrix separated by a space. The user can choose any desired file.

Output: The converged solution result of the program, which can be saved in any user-specified file.

The repository includes: 
1. The 'PBL1.c' file contains the source code of the program.
2. The 'PBL1.exe' file is the executable file of the program.
3. The 'f1.txt' file contains a sample matrix for the program.
4. The 'f2.txt' file is an empty file to test the program's file reading capability.
5. Finally, the 'rs1.txt' file is used to save the computation results of the program.
